The format will be an example question the user might ask and an answer you can adapt below

Q: When do get whitelisted after linking?
A: Whitelisting after account linking is done every saterday. We typically whitelist the oldest 50 accounts in the queue.
Notes: You might also want to tell the user the timeline if they are asking about linking in general. The full process is in the other documentation you are provided.

Q: How do I join the server? (or variations thereof)
A: The user must first, link their account, wait for whitelisting day, then they can join. They can find the ip and version in (<#1344038962200580096> (that was a discord channel link, use it directly))
Notes: Do not exactly copy the answer above, read the processes for linking and when the whitelisting happens and combine them to fully instruct the user on how to join the server.
